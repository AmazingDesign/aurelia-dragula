# Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute and to make this project even better than it is today!

If you submit a code change, add a unit test to cover it.

If you're raising an issue, be explicit and specific, giving enough context for people outside of your project to understand it.

Please don't include the `dist` folder in your pull request - it adds too much noise to the commits.  I will build everything before releasing.
